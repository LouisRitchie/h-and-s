#Data collection and management software 
##Python 2.7 
## Built for a heart disease research charity.

####We are building software modules to complete the following tasks:
1. Grab human-written route descriptions from a spreadsheet. 
2. Interpret the route descriptions accurately, and make the user aware of unintelligible descriptions
3. Use the data from the descriptions to query an online database
4. Collect and organize the returned data into spreadsheets.

####This will allow the charity to have greater success in the absence of volunteers
Every year the charity struggles to find volunteers to work through the 1,300 or so route descriptions by hand. 
The success of their fundraising, and contribution to heart disease research. hangs on finding computer savvy people to complete the tedious, repetitive task of querying the online database with street names, copying down the addresses they want, and placing those in a spreadsheet.
This software will free them from this dependence on volunteers.

Though, it might make their office a lonelier place.
