scrapy 1.0

- Installing scrapy on Ubuntu using 'pip install scrapy' gave me continuous errors. You'll need to run the following command to install Scrapy's dependencies:

apt-get install libffi-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev

That should do it, but you might have to install these packages:

python-dev

Or this older package:

python-lxml

During install, a bunch of yellow warnings about cryptography came up, but ultimately Scrapy was installed.
